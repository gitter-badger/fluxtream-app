Fluxtream is based on Spring(-MVC) 3.1, Spring Security 3.1 and JPA for the persistence. We use Jersey (JAX-WS) for exposing the REST API

This is a maven project with 5 sub-modules.

* core: mainly domain classes, persistence, services and support classes for the other modules (e.g. connectors)
* core-webapp: the web API (with Rest-WS annotations), base oauth classes and helper classes
* connectors: lots of them - but for all but the 10 connectors that are actually enabled, there is little more than basic authentication (sometimes even nothing)
* fluxtream-webapp: the web application you can see on fluxtream.com - in maintenance mode
* fluxtream-web: a new web application that we are starting to work on, based on twitter bootstrap

Build requirements
------------------

* you will need maven 3.x.x
* for interactive development, we use Eclipse Indigo with EE support (/WTP)

Build instructions
------------------

* start by running the install script in fluxtream-app's maven directory, which will install missing dependencies in your local maven repository
* run `mvn install` in fluxtream-app

Tips
----

* We use JRebel during development, which works perfectly well for this application. Since we are open source, you should be able to use jrebel "social" thus without having to pay a license

Running requirements
--------------------

* Tomcat 7 or Jetty 7
* Mysql

Running the application (fluxtream-webapp)
------------------------------------------
* Replace `xxx` in property files under `src/main/resources/samples` with appropriate values (you need only provide oauth keys for the connectors you want to use, obviously); put files under `src/main/resources/samples` back under `src/main/resources`
* You need to set a global environment variable at the OS level of your system, named `TARGET_ENV`; use that value for the name of your environment-specific properties; i.e. if TARGET_ENV is set to 'local', create an environment-specific property file called `local.properties`
* The database is going to be generated for you automatically; all you need to do is set the database name, username and password in your environment-specific property file (e.g. `local.properties`)
* We are using [MaxMind's GeoLiteCity.dat](http://www.maxmind.com) database to map IP addresses to an approximate geolocation; you need to specify that file's location in your environment-specific property file, too (e.g. `local.properties`)
* Inside `TOMCAT_ROOT` / `JETTY_ROOT` there is a `webapps/` directory; either drop the `fluxtream-webapp/target/ROOT.war` there or, or create a symbolic version there pointing to `fluxtream-webapp/target/ROOT`
* Run tomcat: under `TOMCAT_ROOT/bin`, do `./startup.sh` or `./catalina.sh start`
* Do the following only once: when the welcome (/login) screen has appeared it means the application is fully initialized and so should the mysql database; it is now time to import the cities1000.sql at the root of the fluxtream-app project. A simple way to do this is using the command-line: `mysql -u username -ppassword flx <cities1000.sql`
* During development, and if you want to use JRebel (you should), create a symbolic link to the `target/ROOT` directory of the webapp module in Tomcat's or Jetty's `webapps/` directory
* Set some Java options for Tomcat to run happily (`bin/catalina.sh`)
